## Introduction
The Cancer Outlier Detection project aims to detect outliers in medical consultation data using the KMeans clustering algorithm. The project is implemented in Julia and leverages Python libraries such as Scikit-learn for machine learning tasks. The data processing, model creation, and evaluation are all performed in a Jupyter notebook.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:
```sh
CancerOutlierDetection
â”£ ðŸ“‚data
â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œ dataset.csv
â”£ ðŸ“œ main.ipynb
â”— ðŸ“œ README.md
````

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Julia installed along with the required packages. Follow the instructions below to get started:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CancerOutlierDetection.git
   cd CancerOutlierDetection
   ````
2. **Install Julia**:

  Download and install Julia from the official [Julia website](https://julialang.org/).

3. **Install Required Packages**:
  Open Julia and install the required packages:
    ```bash
    -using Pkg
    -Pkg.add("IJulia")
    -Pkg.add("CSV")
    -Pkg.add("DataFrames")
    -Pkg.add("Clustering")
    -Pkg.add("Distances")
    -Pkg.add("Statistics")
    -Pkg.add("ScikitLearn")
    ```

## Usage
To use the outlier detection model, follow these steps:

1. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:

  Launch Jupyter Notebook:
  ```sh
    jupyter notebook
  ````
  Open main.ipynb.
  
2. **Run the Notebook**:

  Execute the cells in the main.ipynb notebook sequentially. The notebook includes the following steps:
    -Data loading
    -Data preprocessing
    -Model creation (KMeans)
    -Model evaluation

## Data
  --File: dataset.csv
  --Location: data folder
  --The dataset contains medical consultation data used for detecting outliers.

## Model
  **KMeans Clustering**
  --Algorithm: KMeans
  --The KMeans algorithm is used to cluster the data and detect outliers.

## Evaluation
The notebook includes sections for evaluating the KMeans model, where various metrics and visualizations are used to assess the performance of the outlier detection.
